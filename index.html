            <h3>A game played with two opposing player singles or pairs of players</h3>
            <p>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or
                between
                two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to
                strike
                a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.</p>

                tournament of Wimbledon, which is the oldest Tournament of the world, taking place in London from 1877.

                <h2>How to play Tennis</h2>
                <h3 class="v">Tennis can be played singly or dubles</h3>
                <p>The goal is to send the ball to the other side, and it must move inside the opponent’s field and
                    always do so
                    until a player does not hit the ball or ends up making a mistake.The game of tennis is composed of 3
                    sets,
                    and who wins the game is who manages to win first 2 sets.The goal is to get to 6 games first. For
                    the set to
                    end, there must be at least one difference between 2 matches between players. If 6 / 6 stays in
                    games, a
                    tie-break will have to be played, which works like an extra game, and whoever can win this game and
                    reach
                    the 7 game first, wins the set.</p>

                <h2>Equipment</h2>
                <h3 class="v">Just a racket and a ball</h3>
                <p>The equipment for practicing tennis are very basic. In terms of clothing, there is no rule that
                    uniforms what
                    should wear, and each player usually wears clothes of similar format that hinder their travel as
                    little as
                    possible. The rest, on just the racket and the ball.</p>
