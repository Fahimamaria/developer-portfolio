            <h3>A game played with two opposing player singles or pairs of players</h3>
            <p>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or
                between
                two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to
                strike
                a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.</p>

            <h2 class="tn">Who started Tennis?</h2>
            <p class="tn">In 1873, Londoner Major Walter Wingfield invented a game called he called Sphairistik√® (Greek
                for
                "playing ball"). Played on an hourglass-shaped court, Wingfield's game created a sensation in Europe,
                the United States, and even China, and is the source from which tennis as we know it today eventually
                evolved.Aug 9, 2019</p>
